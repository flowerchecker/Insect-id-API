## Insect Identification üêû
Send us your insect images encoded in base64, and get a list of possible species suggestions with additional information.
```python
import base64
import requests

# encode images to base64
with open("unknown_insect.jpg", "rb") as file:
    images = [base64.b64encode(file.read()).decode("ascii")]

response = requests.post(
    "https://insect.mlapi.ai/api/v1/identification",
    json={
        "images": images,
        "similar_images": true,
        "details": ["common_names", "url"],
    },
    headers={
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Api-Key": "-- ask for one: https://admin.mlapi.ai/signup --",
    }).json()

for suggestion in response["suggestions"]:
    print(suggestion["insect_name"])    # Lucanus cervus
    print(suggestion["insect_details"]["common_names"])    # European Stag Beetle
    print(suggestion["insect_details"]["url"])    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucanus_cervus
```
